Change the overall colour scheme towards a sunset theme
Dark orange at the bottom of the page, orange-yellow at the top
Focused form inputs should have a 3px border in the same orange-yellow as the top of the gradient.  Background should be white (when focused)  
Number circles and submit button should be white text on dark blue bg
Reset button should be dark orange text on white bg
Change font to Roboto Slab
Visually hide labels for account info fields.  Add descriptive placeholders.
Add checkboxes for Sass and Python under Programming Languages and add a new subheading, DevOps, with checkboxes for GIT, Gulp, and Webpack.  Also, make sure these line up neatly in 3 column rows.

You can either work solo or with a partner on revising your code and resubmitting assignment 01.  Either way, I would like you to:

* Create a git repo from your initial version of Assignment 01 (choose whichever partner's work seems most complete).  This should be your main branch.

* Before making any code changes, create a new branch called blue-master-archive.  This can be a handy way to create snapshots from a point in time without having to check out specific commits.

 ================
* Create 2 new branches (from main) 

	i) sunset-theme ================

	  - Change the colour scheme as described in previous slide and as closely matching the provided screenshot as possible.

	  - Change the font-family to Roboto Slab (link from Google Fonts)

	ii) form-revisions ================

	  - Visually hide the account info labels and add placeholders

	  - Add new checkboxes and DevOps subheading (these should still all be posted as a single checkbox grouping)

	  - Adjust styling of checkboxes to ensure 3 columns

 ================

* Merge sunset-theme and form-revisions into main

* Review your work, together, and add any additional commits on the main branch

* Zip up your work, including the .git directory, and submit via Learning Hub (including a note as to who you worked with on this revision).
